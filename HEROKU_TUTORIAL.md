# Getting your Flask app onto the Internet via Heroku

Up until this point, you have been running your flask app on your home computer, with your computer acting as both the server (via the running Flask app) and the client (via a browser, or a tool on your terminal like curl or wget). In this state, no one except for you can access your app. Heroku is one of a number of companies that help to host your app on the internet, where anyone else connected to the network can access your app.

## Pre-Requisites
1. Ensure that your program works as intended when running locally.
2. Push your code to a repository on Github. You can use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for a simpler user interface.
